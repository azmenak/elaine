          h1 Happy <i>(very belated)</i> Birthday!
          h2 Preface
          p 
            | So I'm not the biggest fan of writing paper cards (not to say I don't like receving them <code>:)</code> ) 
            | they can be lost, and the web is forever!
            | And as a person who makes websites for a living it seems silly not be able to find a better solution.

          h4 Technical Part of the Preface

            | And so, the totally customized birthday website was born! 
            | It runs on any HTTP server, servering static assets. And you're probaly wondering

            blockquote Ummm that's great, but why do I care?

            | and that's a pretty good question; and there are two pretty simple reasons:

          ul
            li No dev stack needed to run (anyone can run and make changes)
            li Its really fast and can be hosted anywhere

          p
            blockquote Cool. But I'm still not seeing it.

            | Basically if you ever want to run your own site (online resume, profile, blog, etc...)
            | it will be really easy to learn/run.
            | AND I throw in free lessons of course <code>:)</code>

          h2 The Card
          p
            | So I know its like <strong>REALLLLLLLLLLY</strong> late, but hopefully you still enjoy it.

          p
            | So here goes: Happy birthday my sweet, my love. This past year has been
            | amazing ride with you, and we're going to be make the next one even better!

          p
            | I also found a card that sums up pretty well how I feel:
