          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
             
            So I'm not the biggest fan of writing paper cards (not to say I don't like receving them <code>:)</code> ) 
            they can be lost, and the web is forever!
            And as a person who makes websites for a living it seems silly not be able to find a better solution.
          </p>
          <h4>Technical Part of the Preface (you can skip this section)</h4>
          <p>
            And so, the totally customized birthday website was born! 
            It runs on any HTTP server, servering static assets. And you're probably wondering
            <blockquote>Ummm that's great, but why do I care?</blockquote>and that's a pretty good question; and there are two pretty simple reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No dev stack needed to run (anyone can run and make changes)</li>
            <li>Its really fast and can be hosted anywhere</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <blockquote>Cool. But I'm still not seeing it.</blockquote>Basically if you ever want to run your own site (online resume, profile, blog, etc...)
            it will be really easy to learn/run.
            AND I throw in free lessons of course <code>:)</code>
          </p>
          <h4>Features of Totally Awesome Online Birthday Card</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Your friends will all be jealous that their boyfriends can't code them a birthday website</li>
            <li>Totally static = <strong>FREE HOSTING</strong>. (currently using github's servers)</li>
            <li>Completely responsive (works great on your phone), based on the latest <code>foundation 5</code></li>
            <li>Will last <i>forever</i> and is even prone to updates</li>
            <li>More to come... <code>;)</code></li>
          </ul>
          <div class="panel radius">
            <h2>The Card</h2>
            <p>So I know its like <strong>REALLLLLLLLLLY</strong> late, but hopefully you still enjoy it.</p>
            <p>
              So here goes: Happy birthday my sweet, my love. This past year has been
              amazing ride with you, and we're going to be make the next one even better!
            </p>
            <p>I also found a card that sums up pretty well how I feel:</p>
            <p><img src="/images/card_poop_taco.jpg"></p>
            <p>
              I can't imagine not having you around, and hanging out with you 
              (regardless of what we do) is still my favourite thing thing to do.
            </p>
            <h3>Have an AMAZING year of being 21!</h3>
